Compliance debt is a type of technical debt that incurs when companies delay or postpone compliance with laws and regulations in relation to their products.

In Spring of 2018, I did an independent study with [Dr. Carolyn Seaman](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~cseaman/) where a proposal was developed about asking if awareness of compliance debt leads to better compliance debt management. Since compliance debt is a generally new idea, a lot of the research was based off of literature available on technical debt management techniques.
