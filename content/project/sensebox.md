![SenseBox Project](featured.jpg)

I have been working on the SenseBox under [Dr. Foad Hamidi](http://www.foadhamidi.info/) for over a year now. It is an open-source, low-cost, customizable hardware/software prototyping platform to turn everyday objects into audio triggers for users with diverse abilities.

My specific contributions have been about documentation and simplifying instructions. [Click here to view the SenseBox documentation and an accompanying poster.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z5RPWJCwYCpCkvLv8kIiUE1-kjBkEnQI?usp=sharing)
