![SenseBox Project](/img/display.jpg)

I have been working on the SenseBox under [Dr. Foad Hamidi](http://www.foadhamidi.info/) for over a year now. It is an open-source, low-cost, customizable hardware/software prototyping platform to turn everyday objects into audio triggers for users with diverse abilities.

My biggest contributions have primarily been about documentation and simplifying instructions. But, I also assisted in creating the SenseBox software, and I experimented with the fabrication process.
