## Personalized Learning ##
I decided to choose personalized learning because of my passion for computer science education that I developed while at UMBC. I have worked on assistive technology for over 2 years and realized that integrating assistive devices to create learning platforms for users will disabilities would fit under personalized learning best. This is also what I plan on studying in graduate school.

#### Motivation

I wanted to participate in the Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP) because I have always enjoyed interdisciplinary work. As I was preparing to go into graduate school, I wanted to think critically about what I wanted to work on as PhD student, but more importantly, how what I was doing would benefit the world at large. GCSP focuses on issues that we are currently facing on a global skill and I wanted to get a head start on one of the challenges.

## Experiences

#### Interdisciplinarity

I have a minor in Information Systems. The courses I have taken have a lot to do with management, business and analyzing a system. This is important for personalized learning because when creating technology that focuses on personalizing learning, it is important to understand how the system currently works, finding the issues, and developing potential solutions. Through IS, I also learned that solutions are not “one-size fits-all”.

#### Research

My biggest contributions have primarily been about documentation and simplifying instructions. But, I also assisted in creating the SenseBox software, and I experimented with the fabrication process.
