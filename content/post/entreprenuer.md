I propose participation in an entrepreneurship competition. Texas Instruments offered participation to innovate using the TI-RSLK MAX robot kit for interns in the summer of 2019. Robots should be configured to a line and/or distance sensor to move through a maze. Robots are judged on speed, power efficiency and creativity. I worked with a fellow intern and we spent about 4 hours per week for 8 weeks working directly on the robot. I personally spent an extra 30 hours of my own time learning about electrical engineering concepts like pulse width modulation and get the robot to move and turn. I followed the [TI-RSLK university curriculum](https://university.ti.com/en/faculty/ti-robotics-system-learning-kit/ti-rslk-max-edition-curriculum) to learn how to use bluetooth and wi-fi microcontrollers and integrate them in the robot.

## Reflection ##
This experience is relatively well tied to the Advancing Personalized Learning Challenge. A lot of the work I want to do around advancing personalized learning is related to accessibility and robot kits like the one I used to create the robot are relatively accessible. I learned a lot of electrical engineering and using microcontrollers in a relatively short period of time by playing around with the robot and following the online documentation available. Robot kits like that also have a relatively low cost and allow beginners to immerse themselves in robotics in a low risk way.

### Learning Objectives ###
This entrepreneurship experience contributed primarily to realistic vision for me. In this process, I was not as realistic with my time to ensure the successful completion of the robot. We spent more time on design than we did on making sure the robot fulfilled its purpose of matriculating through a maze.

**Develop strategies for recognizing opportunities and identifying the tools for quality risk assessment.**
Participating in the robotics competition was optional and I signed up because I wanted to learn more about robotics and microcontrollers.

**Exhibit skills for communicating ideas in a concise and logical way.**
My teammate knew a lot more about working with microcontrollers than I did, so he did a great job of explaining C instructions to me. On my end, I had a lot of design ideas and I learned how to communicate those in a way that made sense for the activity at hand.

**Work effectively in teams focused on entrepreneurship-related projects.**
I collaborated with a fellow intern on this project and we worked on design together.

**Apply entrepreneurial thinking to social issues and social problems.**
Working on this project definitely kept me mindful of cost and documentation/instruction accessibility so that as many people as possible can participate in a learning environment.

**Network effectively with area entrepreneurs.**
While working on the robot, I received a lot of support from coworkers in the embedded processing group at Texas Instruments. Many of these coworkers entire jobs were to develop software and games for the microcontrollers to show customers to the microcontroller can be used. I made a lot of connections by asking about how to use different microcontrollers and the associated software.
