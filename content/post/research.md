I have a minor in Information Systems. The courses I have taken have a lot to do with management, business and analyzing a software system. This is important for personalized learning because when creating technology that focuses on personalizing learning, it is important to understand how the system currently works, finding the issues, and developing potential solutions. Through IS, I also learned that solutions are not “one-size fits-all”. Courses like Human-Computer Interactions (IS 303) and User Interface Design (IS 403) were particularly helpful for learning about accessibility.

I propose a Nation Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Software Safety at the University of Texas at Dallas. Through this REU, I learned to analyze a system and find potential hazards in order to prevent them from happening. I looked at a stair-climbing, self-balancing wheelchair developed by research at ETH Zurich and got feedback from the researchers there about the fault tree we developed. I found that some of the potential safety issues in the system could result in someone falling out their wheelchair and possibly getting injured.This REU entails 40 hours of research a week for 10 weeks from May 19th to July 20th, 2017. Accounting for a late start due to UMBC’s final exams and activities sponsored by the NSF, this brings the total time commitment to about 365 hours.

<h1 style="color: gold">Entrepreneurship</h1>
I developed software at two, twelve-week internships at Texas Instruments. During my IT internship, I built a webpage that improved managers’ ability to track employee assignments. The following summer I was in Embedded Processing and I built a robot, TI RSLK MAX. My major project involved me creating software that automated testing when changes were detected. Working at Texas Instruments made me a better programmer and engineer. So, I now have many of the skills required to create accessible interfaces for personalized learning. In addition, I was able to work with microcontrollers and realized that their low cost may make them ideal for whatever I decide to create.

<h1 style="color: #cd7f32">Global</h1>
TBD – Either German 100 or Music of the World. I applied for the Fulbright Research Abroad in Germany, and I plan to collaborate with people all around the world as a graduate student and beyond.

<h1 style="color: gold">Service</h1>
I have completed over 100 hours of service as a leader in Computer Science Education. This has included partnerships with Lakeland Elementary/Middle School, Lansdowne High School, and North County High School. This also includes organizing [Hour of Code events at UMBC.](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/2019/01/hour-of-code-brings-baltimore-3rd-and-4th-graders-to-umbc-for-fun-intro-to-computing/)<br />
I have learned a lot about what makes different students excited about learning and different modes of learning, particularly in tech and computer science.
